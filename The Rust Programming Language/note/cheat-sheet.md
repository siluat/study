# My cheat sheet for Rust

## Variables

```rust
let x = 5;  // variables are immutable by default
let mut y = 5;  // mutable variables are declared with `mut`
```

## Constants

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
// MUST be annotated with a type, SHOULD be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
```
